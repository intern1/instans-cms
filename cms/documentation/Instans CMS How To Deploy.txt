INSTANS CMS DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
-----------------------------

VERSION + DOWNLOAD
*	Update $cmsVersion and $cmsBuild in cms_baseconfig.inc.php 
*	Create release entry in /cms/documentation/cms_history.txt
*	If database, config or file structure has changed, update installer accordingly - particularly you should update the /resources/db-structure.sql file
*	Download all changes to "instans.dk DEV"

DEV BACKUP
*	Backup "instans.dk DEV"-folder into "Instans.dk_VERSIONS" and rename it "dev_2.7.X" according to version
*	Make structure-only dump of dev database and place it into "Instans.dk_VERSIONS" with the name "web00228_dev_2.X.X.sql". Remember to uncheck the "Add AUTO_INCREMENT value" checkbox


CREATE NEW VERSION
*	Copy "instans.dk DEV"-folder into "Instans.dk_VERSIONS" and rename it DEPLOY2.7.X
*	From the new DEPLOY-folder, delete:
		- any .DSSTORE file
		- any root-folder marked "IKKE_DEPLOY"
 		- any files in /includes/uploaded_files/
 		- any files in /includes/uploaded_pictures/
 		- any files in /includes/images/gfxheadings_cache/
 		- any files in /includes/images/shopimages_cache/
 		- any files in /includes/templates/smarty_templates_c
		- any files in /feeds/
*	Empty these files so they are 0 bytes:
		- .htaccess file
		- cms_config.inc.php file


TEST NEW VERSION
*	Copy the contents of the deploy folder to a vacant spot - for instance project1.instans.dk
*	Remember to blank the database!
*	Run the installer and check that the example-site comes up. 
*	Log-in to the cms and test that this is running as well.

DEPLOY
